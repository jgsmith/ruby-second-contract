            The inn radiates age and charm with its oak beam roof and many
            seafaring momentos secured firmly around the walls. Even the bar
            is a single thick oak slab, worn and chipped with years of 
            service to rowdy sailors. An old glass window lets in a little 
            light from outside. A game room is to the south and a parlor is 
            to the southeast. A party room is at the bottom of a flight of 
            stairs.
