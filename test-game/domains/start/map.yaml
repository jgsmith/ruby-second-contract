        sight: "The inn radiates age and charm with its oak beam roof and many seafaring momentos secured firmly around the walls. Even the bar is a single thick oak slab, worn and chipped with years of service to rowdy sailors. An old glass window lets in a little light from outside. A game room is to the south and a parlor is to the southeast. A party room is at the bottom of a flight of stairs."
